#ExpandableSwipeListView

This is an example code of how to use [https://github.com/47deg/android-swipelistview](https://github.com/47deg/android-swipelistview) on the childs of an ExpandableListView.

All the credits go to 47 Degrees since they are the ones who created the swipelistview library. I just decided to share the code that I once needed to use in order to be able to swipe rows on ExpandableListView childs. Feel free to use and adapt the code if you also need this. There might be better ways of doing some part of the code but, at least this works and worked well for my case.
